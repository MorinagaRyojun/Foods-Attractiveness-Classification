## Introduction
Classifying food attractiveness can provide valuable insight into people's preferences. And it can be used in areas such as restaurant recommendations, marketing, and food industry analysis. The project aims to develop a CNN-based model that can classify the attractiveness of popular foods such as sushi, ramen and burgers, among others.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of food images sourced from Instagram. The images were manually labeled with two attractiveness classes: Best and worst The dataset was split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance accurately.

## This project is still in the process of research to further improve the quality.
